This project is developing tools to Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) MIAPA-compliant data from NeXML files.

It is part of a Google Summer of Code project sponsored by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham, North Carolina, USA

	 == Extract ==
To extract MIAPA-relevant information out of NeXML files I'll use XSL files and a Java-based XSLT processor.  This processor is currently Saxon 9 HE.

	== Transform ==
I'll transform the extracted information above into ISAtab files.

	  == Load ==
The ISAtab files should be able to be loaded into ISAtools for curation, etc, workflows.
